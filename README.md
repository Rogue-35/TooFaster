# TooFaster
This is a Minecraft Mod that removes the speed limit. 
I'm unsure why this happens, but it overrides the limitation in Minecraft that throws the "[Playername] moved too fast."  This is an updated replacement for that aspect of the Random Patches mod that has since been deprecated. Built for servers, **untested** in single player
